# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project focuses on building an intelligent Recommendation System that suggests relevant items to users based on their preferences and interaction patterns. The goal is to improve user experience and engagement by providing personalized recommendations using data-driven techniques.

The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model development to generate meaningful recommendations. Various similarity and embedding techniques are applied to understand relationships between users and items and to recommend the most relevant content.

The system demonstrates how recommendation engines are designed and implemented in real-world applications such as e-commerce, OTT platforms, music streaming services, and content platforms.
